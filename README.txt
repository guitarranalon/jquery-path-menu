Just saw Victor Coulon's Path menu in pure CSS3 (http://lab.victorcoulon.fr/css/path-menu/) and wanted to try something similar using jQuery.

In order to make it work you need to put in the js folder:
- jQuery library js file.
- jQuery UI js file (it only uses the easing animation effects)
- jQuery Rotate (http://code.google.com/p/jqueryrotate/) in order to [yeah! you guessed] rotate the images
