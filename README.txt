Just saw Victor Coulon's Path menu in pure CSS3 (http://lab.victorcoulon.fr/css/path-menu/) and wanted to try something similar but using jQuery.

Demo: http://petra.euitio.uniovi.es/~i6949124/jquery-path/

In order to make it work you need to put in the js folder:
- jQuery library js file.
- jQuery UI js file (it only uses the easing animation effects)
- jQuery Rotate (http://code.google.com/p/jqueryrotate/) in order to [yeah! you guessed] rotate the images

It has been tested in the following browsers with the specified result:
- Firefox 8: OK
- Chrome : OK
- Opera : OK
- IE8, IE7: No CSS3 styles like rounded corners and no rotation
- IE6: are you serious?
